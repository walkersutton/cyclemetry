"""
designer types
* point_label, cadence, course, elevation, gradient, heartrate, sub_point, imperial, metric, time, temperature, scene -> object
* labels -> list[dict]
* units -> list[str]
* hide -> boolean
* dpi, x, y, width, height, rotation, x_offset, y_offset, round, fps -> int
* line_width, point_weight, margin, opacity, fill_opacity, font_size -> float
* color -> string(hex or ______)
* suffix, overlay_filename, text -> str

notes:
* i think speed should be a list of dict (simlar to labels) rather than including hide and opacity at top level
* use the above types to write some sort of template validator -> similar to validating form inputs on payment web views
  * and use the types and validator to design template form behaviro -> encourage users to populate fields where required
    but also give option to extend template for additinoal customizability
* i know that flask supports forms - i think we should be able to leverage that -
